467,"@Reuters @MadSqParkNYC If you want to see ghost forests on an industrial scale go to the southeastern US to see clear cut forests.

469,"Notably, the report did not shortlist biomass energy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS). @theCCCuk has called for 10m tonnes of CO2 removal from CCS by 2030, but this report said UK CCS removals are ""unlikely to be available for widescale application by 2030""."

Hell let’s go all out with biomass energy so we can burn every tree in Canada and get our carbon footprint up,( up the carbon tax to offset it)

2272,@latimes @latimesopinion California is slowly eliminating biomass energy facilities and cutting down on forest management which has resulted in overgrowth and an abundance of dead trees and brush. Biomass burning is considered environmentally friendly source of energy and yet California doesn’t use it.

6738,"@SturmLLiouville @ODouglasPrice @ShellenbergerMD @Greenpeace Nations choose to have a domestic supply of sugar for strategic reasons and that seems reasonable to me. Using some biomass as fuel is fine if they are waste products, like sawdust in sawmills. But scaled biomass energy needs more than just our waste steams."
6739,"@nrgdnz @ODouglasPrice @ShellenbergerMD @Greenpeace "" Biomass energy systems establish long term fuel demand""

No."
6740,@ODouglasPrice @SturmLLiouville @ShellenbergerMD @Greenpeace True. Biomass energy systems establish long term fuel demand. Expand them and so too does the fuel demand and hence pressure on the biosphere.  Wood and fiber crops are more useful for building and can provide short cycle carbon sequestration too (up to 100 years or so).
